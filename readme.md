Rohub.linkeddata.es
==

This project contains the documentation for rohub.linkeddata.es, which is a simple web page application to:

* Given a set of URI belonging to one or more Research Objects, extract the rdf-a annotations about the title and abstract of each one.
* Paint and list all the resources as an html web page.

The rdf-a parser we use is http://semarglproject.org/. 

If you want to add more Research Objects just edit the Constants file and regenerate the Web (re execute the jsp file). 

Note that the Research Objects should be well formed and without errors in the html.
